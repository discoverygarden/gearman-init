# Upstart: Gearman Worker Scripts

## Introduction

Upstart scripts/configuration to start Gearman workers.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora Job](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_job)
* Gearman CLI Script (Ubuntu: "gearman" package)

## Installation

Clone/unzip into `/opt` such that we have:
* `/opt/gearman-init/gearman-defaults.sh` and
* `/opt/gearman-init/gearman-worker.sh`

Provide any configuration necessary in `/etc/default/gearman-workers`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `DRUPAL_ROOT` | `/var/www/drupal7` | Path to Drupal's root installation directory, so we can call Drush in the correct context. |
| `DRUSH` | The result of `which drush`. | Path of the `drush` executable. |
| `CPU_COUNT` | The number of CPU cores present on the system. | Something of a misnomer? The number of worker processes to create. |
| `GEARMAN_HOST` | The configured value from the "default" Drupal site. | The host/IP of the Gearman server. |
| `GEARMAN_PORT` | The configured value from the "default" Drupal site. | The port to connect to on the Gearman server host. |
| `GEARMAN_BIN` | The result of `which gearman`. | Path of the `gearman` CLI executable. |
| `GEARMAN_USER` | `www-data` | The user as which to run Gearman workers. |
| `ROUTER` | The Drush command `islandora-job-router`, as user 1 and at `DRUPAL_ROOT`. | The routing command workers should send the Gearman payload to for processing. |
| `SITE_URI_LIST` | The "Site URI" portion of each entry in `drush @sites status` | A space-separated list of sites to get worker functions for. |
| `CUSTOM_WORKER_FUCTIONS` | String of functions for a custom worker | formated as such: "-f function1 -f function2". Defaults to "-f default"   |

## upstart

Copy the `upstart/gearman-workers.conf` and `upstart/gearman-worker.conf` files into `/etc/init`.

The workers should start and stop automatically at boot/shutdown (currently following/preceding `mysql` of startup/shutdown; may be desirable to make into configuration at some point?).

To start the workers immediately:
```bash
start gearman-workers
```

## sysvinit

Copy the `sysvinit/gearman-workers` and `sysvinit/gearman-worker` files into `/etc/init.d`.

Ensure permissions are 755

If gearmand processes has a different name, the gearman-worker and gearman-workers files will need to be updated at `# Required-Start:`

To have the gearman workers start on system boot, run the following:
```bash
# UBUNTU:
/usr/sbin/update-rc.d gearman-workers defaults 99 20
# REDHAT:
chkconfig --add gearman-workers
```

To start the workers immediately:
```bash
/etc/init.d/gearman-workers start
```
## systemd

Copy `systemd/` files into `/etc/systemd/system`.  Note Ubuntu uses `gearman-job-server`, whereas RHEL uses `gearmand`.  You may have to modify the `After=` and `Requires=` in the service files depending on how split out the stack is.  For example, does the daemon/server live on the same VM as mysql/maria, and does the worker live on the same VM as the daemon/server?

### Mysql on a different server

The portopen@.service file can be used to wait for mysql to be started on a different server before gearmand is started, copy the file to /etc/systemd/system and run `systemctl enable portopen@localhost.service` replace localhost with the hostname of your mysql server.

Update the gearmand service file After= Requires= PartOf= to be the same as `portopen@localhost.service` that was enabled.

### Enable on boot
where `n` is the total number of `Requires=` added to the `gearman-workers.target`

```
systemctl enable gearman-worker@{1..n}.service
```

### Status/start/stop
```
systemctl status gearman-workers.target
systemctl start gearman-workers.target
systemctl stop gearman-workers.target
```

Most options in the /etc/default/gearman-workers file has to be set, specially the path to binary ones as these are not available to the system at boot time.

## Custom Worker
(optional)

### Add custom function

Add your custom working functions to `/etc/default/gearman-workers` in the following format:
```
CUSTOM_WORKER_FUCTIONS="-f function1 -f function2 -f function3"
```

Ensure total number of workers does not exceed total number of CPU cores. May have to configure the `CPU_COUNT` var as well.

### systemd

Stop workers as we are going to edit the gearman-workers.target file.

```
systemctl stop gearm-workers.target
```

Create custom workers service file.

```
cat <<EOT >/etc/systemd/system/gearman-custom-worker@.service
#gearman-worker jobs process, requires gearmand - DGI
[Unit]
Description=Gearman Custom Worker %i
Requires=gearman-job-server.service
PartOf=gearman-workers.target

[Service]
Environment=OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1
WorkingDirectory=/opt/gearman-init
User=www-data
ExecStart=/opt/gearman-init/gearman-custom-worker.sh %i
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOT
```

Edit `/etc/systemd/system/gearman-workers.target` to reflect that you now need to start custom workers.
eg.

```
[Unit]
Description=Gearman Workers
Requires=gearman-worker@1.service
Requires=gearman-custom-worker@1.service
Requires=gearman-custom-worker@2.service
```

#### Enable on boot

Just like the standard workers above, we have to enable or disable what we want to start with systemctl

```
systemctl enable gearman-custom-worker@{1..2}.service
```

Start your workers

```
systemctl start gearman-workers.taget
```

### Upstart

Copy `upstart/gearman-custom-worker.conf` files into `/etc/init`.

```
stop gearman-workers
start gearman-workers
```

Your Custom worker should start with all the others.


## Check workers

Check that the workers are configured as you like with `gearadmin --status`

```
root@ingest:~# gearadmin --st
is3b-ro	0	0	1
ijj-d	0	0	3
is3b-do	0	0	1
is3b-rc	0	0	1
is3b-bc	0	0	1
is3b-bo	0	0	1
is3b-dc	0	0	1
.
```

## Note

There is a bug in gearman that may cause issue if the listening host/IP doesn't match the worker connection host/IP, ensure these are the same.
